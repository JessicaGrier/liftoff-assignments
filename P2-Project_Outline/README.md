# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  As an adult with an elderly parent who requires living assistance, I recognize the need for a tool that will enable my siblings and me to share the duties of caring for our mother based on our personal availability. My vision of this application includes three independent user perspectives that will allow my elderly mother to make requests for groceries or rides to appointments; my siblings and myself to respond to these requests, plan a rotation or schedule to assist her with rides and even provide medication reminders, or make payments or payment arrangements on her behalf; as well as the staff where she resides to submit schedule updates, request supplies, respond to her needs in our stead, or easily review the familyâ€™s preferences or directives such as who to contact in a particular scenario or emergency.
  My focus for Liftoff will be on the rotation of duty/responsibility among family members. The user(s) can be anyone outside of the patient's residence that assumes responsibility for his/her care.  In my case, I have four siblings.  Each of us has our own family, job, and set of personal circumstances that dictate our availability. We should be able to view our mother's calendar for upcoming events within the app and either volunteer for that event, be automatically designated based on pre-set availability, or quickly see that someone else has already done so. In such a case where none of us are available, there will be a link to an external resource such as the facility itself or Uber to make other arrangements for our mother.
  
### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page where individual availability can be set.
Calendar view: Users will be able to view a calendar containing all upcoming events or appointments for a single patient and see who has been assigned "duty" for that event.
Create/Edit: family members will be able to create new, review existing, or edit any event on the patient's calendar for accuracy.

### Technologies
JavaScript
MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
How to interact with and add multiple features to a calendar as well as granting varying user permissions.
